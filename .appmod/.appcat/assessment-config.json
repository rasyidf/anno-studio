Two examples on how to configure properly.

Example one: you'd like to migrate your apps to Azure but haven't decided on the target compute service yet.
{
  "appcat": {
    "target": "Any"
  }
}

Example two: you'd like to migrate your apps to App Service Linux and want to understand what are the issues to be fixed.
{
  "appcat": {
    "target": "AppService.Linux"
  }
}
*/
{
  "appcat": {
    "target": "Any"
  }
}
